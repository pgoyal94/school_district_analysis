# An Analysis of School District Scores and Spending
Performing anaylsis on school funding and standardized test scores to help Maria advise the school district in its discussions and decision making process.

## Overview of the Project
In this analysis, we helped Maria find the following:
1. A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format

2. An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
3. Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
    - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
    - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
    - School performance based on the budget per student
    - School performance based on the school size 
    - School performance based on the type of school

## Results
1. The district summary (below) shows an aggregate view of the district's performance. This data table is largely unchanged from the results we saw in the module. The main difference is added granularity as this dataframe shows data to the tenth of a percent.

2. The school summary (below) is also similar to that in the module. It is slightly varied from the earlier dataframe, specifically due to the changes we made to the data relating to Thomas High School (THS). We were alerted of potential academic dishonesty and that THS' ninth grade scores had been altered. Due to this, we helped Maria remove all of these scores from our analysis. This appears to have dropped the average scores at THS by >0.5%.
